parameters :
    target_seqs :
        ui-name : |
            Target sequences
        short-hint : |
            Copy/paste the target nucleotide sequences in FASTA format
        long-hint  : |
            additional information can be placed here
    query :
        ui-name : |
            Query Sequence
        short-hint : |
            Copy/paste the nucleotide sequence in FASTA format
    e-value :
        ui-name : E-value
        short-hint : E-value cut off threshold. Results with an expected value above this threshold will not be returned
    output_name :
        ui-name : Output object name
        short-hint : Your desired output object name in the workspace
    gap_opening_penalty :
        ui-name : Gap opening penalty
        short-hint : The cost to open new gap where gap is inserted in an alignment
    gap_extension_penalty :
        ui-name : Gap extension penalty
        short-hint : The cost of extending an existing gap
    nucleotide_match_reward :
        ui-name : Nucleotide match reward
        short-hint : The reward for a nucleotide match
    nucleotide_mismatch_penalty :
        ui-name : Nucleotide mismatch penalty
        short-hint : The penalty of a nucleotide mismatch
    word_size :
        ui-name : Word size
        short-hint : The size of the initial word that must be matched between the query sequence and target sequence. The default is 11 for blastn and 28 for megablast
    maximum_alignment_2show :
        ui-name : Number of alignments
        short-hint : Maximum number of alignments to show
    extending_hits :
        ui-name : Threshold for extending hits
        short-hint : Specify threshold for extending hits
    maximum_seq_2show :
        ui-name : Max target sequences
        short-hint : Select the maximum number of aligned sequences to display
    mega_blast :
        ui-name : Algorithm
        short-hint : The default is blastn. Use Megablast for comparing a query to closely related sequences
    gapped_alignment :
        ui-name : Gapped alignment
        short-hint : Perform gapped alignment
    filter_query_seq :
        ui-name : Filter query sequence
        short-hint : Filter out segments of the query sequence that have low compositional complexity

    <p>Blast is a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool and was developed by Altschul et al. 1990 [1]. KBase provides a BLAST tool for sequence search against one or more KBase genomes.</p> 
    <p>KBase “BLASTN search against sequences” takes a nucleotide query sequence as an input and searches for it against the target sequences given by the user.</p>
    <p>It aligns the query sequence against every subject sequence and reports the results (above a certain similarity threshold set by the user) in the form of a ranked list of hits.</p>
    <p>Every hit in the list is assigned a similarity score, an E-value and an identity score. Since the BLAST algorithm uses a heuristic approach, the E-value indicates the likelihood of an alignment happening purely by chance and thus provides the expected number of random hits associated with that score.</p>
