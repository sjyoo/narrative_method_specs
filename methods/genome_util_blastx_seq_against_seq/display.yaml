parameters :
    target_seqs :
        ui-name : |
            Target sequences
        short-hint : |
            Copy/paste the target amino-acid sequences in FASTA format
        long-hint  : |
            additional information can be placed here
    query :
        ui-name : |
            Query Sequence
        short-hint : |
            Copy/paste the nucleotide sequence in FASTA format
    e-value :
        ui-name : E-value
        short-hint : E-value cut off threshold. Results with an expected value above this threshold will not be returned
    output_name :
        ui-name : Output object name
        short-hint : Your desired output object name in the workspace
    gap_opening_penalty :
        ui-name : Gap opening penalty
        short-hint : The cost to open new gap where gap is inserted in an alignment
    gap_extension_penalty :
        ui-name : Gap extension penalty
        short-hint : The cost of extending an existing gap
    word_size :
        ui-name : Word size
        short-hint : The size of the initial word that must be matched between the query sequence and target sequence. The default is 3.
    maximum_alignment_2show :
        ui-name : Number of alignments
        short-hint : Maximum number of alignments to show. The default is 15.
    gapped_alignment :
        ui-name : Gapped alignment
        short-hint : Perform gapped alignment
    filter_query_seq :
        ui-name : Filter query sequence
        short-hint : Filter out segments of the query sequence that have low compositional complexity
    extending_hits :
        ui-name : Threshold for extending hits
        short-hint : Specify threshold for extending hits
    maximum_seq_2show :
        ui-name : Max target sequences
        short-hint : Select the maximum number of aligned sequences to display
    substitution_matrix :
        ui-name : Substitution matrix
        short-hint : The name of the alignment matrix that contains a reward or penalty for each possible match or mismatch. The default is BLOSUM-62.

    <p>Blast is a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool and was developed by Altschul et al. 1990 [1]. KBase provides a BLAST tool for sequence search against one or more KBase genomes.</p> 
    <p>KBase “BLASTX search against sequences” takes a nucleotide sequence as an input and searches for it against the target amino-acid sequences given by the user.</p>
    <p>It translates the query nucleotide sequence to protein sequence and aligns it against every subject protein sequence in the targeted genome and reports the results (above a certain similarity threshold set by the user) in the form of a ranked list of hits.</p>
    <p>Every hit in the list is assigned a similarity score, an E-value and an identity score. Since the BLAST algorithm uses a heuristic approach, the E-value indicates the likelihood of an alignment happening purely by chance and thus provides the expected number of random hits associated with that score.</p>
